      <p>Hello World! My name is Lukasz, I come from Poland. I have master degree in Cognitive Science, but my true passion is programming.
      I'm JavaScript developer. Professionally I'm working with vanilla JavaScript now (front side and some Node.js on backend side), but I have (and I love) React.js.
      Now I'm learning Redux and building my portfolio. And this is reason for this page - I want to show you my free time projects.
      I will add here games coded in JavaScript, vanilla js landing pages and more complexed apps in React. I hope you will enjoy it!
