      <p>Hello World! My name is Lukasz, I come from Poland. I have master degree in Cognitive Science, but my true passion is programming.
      I mainly deal with front-end JavaScript, but sometimes I do some stuff in Node.js. Currently I'm trying to get more experience with React.js and Redux.
      I want to show you my free time projects and I hope that you will enjoy it :) All my code is open-source so feel free to use it.
      I will add here games coded in JavaScript, landing pages and more complexed apps in React. I hope you will enjoy it!
